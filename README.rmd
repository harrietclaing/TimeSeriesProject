# Purpose
To replicate the study by Cologni & Manera to find the economic impact of a rise in oil prices.

```{r}
rm(list = ls()) # Clean your environment:
gc() # garbage collection - It can be useful to call gc after a large object has been removed, as this may prompt R to return memory to the operating system.
library(tidyverse)
```
# Step 1: Find the data
First, we want to use US data and see if we can replicate the results in the study. We need to convert all the data into quarterly, except for interest rates.
